# Hacknet Plus Plus

This is a small clone of the legendary [Hacknet](http://hacknet-os.com/), but coded in C++, and terminal only (for now at least).
There isn't much going on yet, but feel free to check it out, and, if you feel like it, dropping an issue or something.

### Compilation: 
I, [tarche](https://github.com/lucastarche) personally compile it using g++ with std=c++11, but thanks to [Lucina](https://github.com/Lucina) now there is also a cmake file for your convinience.
