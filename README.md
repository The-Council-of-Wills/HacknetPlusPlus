# Hacknet Plus Plus

This is a small clone of the legendary [Hacknet](http://hacknet-os.com/), but coded in C++, and terminal only (for now at least).
There isn't much going on yet, but feel free to check it out, and, if you feel like it, dropping an issue or something.

Compilation: 
I have tested it out using g++ with C++11, but it should probably work with clang++, and maybe another C++ standards, but I can't know for sure.
In case it isn't clear, the file you have to compile is [/src/main.cpp](https://github.com/lucastarche/HacknetPlusPlus/blob/master/src/main.cpp).
